An open source program is a free program that has all of its source code readily available for anyone to run, modify or build upon.
This plays exactly into why there are so many distributions of Linux. Many people need many different things, and people took the base Linux Kernal 
and tailored the rest of the operating system to whatever they needed. A distribution is just a version of Linux that was built for a specific purpose.
Red Hat and CentOS are mainly used for server side development, Ubuntu and Mint are great for your average person, Kali can be used for penetration testing, 
and many more! There are even Distributions dedicated for being Video Game Emulator, Video Surveillance, for working on a Raspberry Pi, etc.

Part 2:
I have always been a huge fan of Linux. I'm really looking forward to learning how to use Linux more effectively because I love it! Sadly, I have not been given the 
opportunity to use it in quite some time, but I'm excited to get back into it. I also look forward to learning a lot of the cyber security. I will soon be running
an IT department for a small school district, and I will need to be able to advise them of the safest option of a given problem. I will need to become familar with
certain types of cyber attacks and how to prevent them. I am looking forward to this bootcamp quite a bit!
